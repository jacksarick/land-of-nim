# Land Of Nim

A game I'm making. It's text based and online and multiplayer and maybe fun?

## Battle Plan

Here's the outline:

Connect to server

Screen contains both characters stats, map, log of recent actions, and input.

Pick a class (maybe build it?)

Characters take turns issuing commands

Turn break down:
	- Start
	- Gain X energy
	- Issue command
	- Execute command
	- Evaluate
	- Broadcast result
	- End

First one dead loses
